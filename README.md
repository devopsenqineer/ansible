# Ansible Custom Hyper V modules

This repo contains a full repo about creating one or multiples virtual machines based on hyper-v. 

The project was created because there was no suitable Ansible module for Hyper-V virtual machine creation and so it has grown accordingly. 

You can also create a own active directory with this repo.

A blog series based on this repo will be available on my [Blog](https://devopsenqineer.github.io/blog/).

## Installation

Download the folder and run follow command:
